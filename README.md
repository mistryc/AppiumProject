# AppiumProject

The use cases that I chose for testing are:
1.	User should be able to skip the initial pages related to sign up activity and should be able to land on the homepage just by selecting a location
2.	User should be able to login to the application when he is on the homepage
3.	User should be able to search for the events based on their interest of time, location and mood
4.	User should be able to book free tickets even if he is not logged in
5.	User should be able to see the error on the page when wrong location is searched
